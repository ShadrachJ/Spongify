## Welcome to Spongify

You've landed on the repository holding the files necessary for running the Spongify website. Contained within are various HTML files for different sections of the website (pending a switch to an Angular implementation). 

### Contributors 

Any non-offensive features are welcome! If I gain enough features I intend to switch to a dropdown menu to more compactly contain the various sections of the website. I ask that the CSS grid be used consistently accross pages.
